These are the materials for the National Center for Data Services (NCDS) Library Carpentry Workshop. I completed <a href="https://nnlm-carpentries.github.io/2022-07-18-ncds-online/">these lessons</a> on July 18-19, 2022.
I learned about the Unix Shell, setting up a GitHub repository, and cleaning data with OpenRefine.
